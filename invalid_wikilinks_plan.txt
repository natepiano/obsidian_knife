We now have the ability to track InvalidWikilinkReasons
Following is a plan for how we should handle them

File-Level Tracking:
Invalid wikilinks must be tracked per file, not globally
Store invalid wikilinks in MarkdownFileInfo structure
Each invalid wikilink should maintain its context (line number, content)

Implementation Constraints:
Make minimal, incremental changes
Keep all tests passing at each step
Modify existing tests rather than creating new ones when possible
Use TempDir for all file operation tests
Keep changes localized until necessary to expand - that is, Don't change return signatures until we've handled each step so we don't have to do one big global change

Proposed Step-by-Step Plan:
Update scan_markdown_file to appropriately pass back the ExtractedWikilinks struct and its caller to
properly add invalid links to MarkDownFileInfo

Modify MarkdownFileInfo / scan_markdown_file
Add invalid_wikilinks field to store InvalidWikilink instances on each individual MarkdownFileInfo instances
Update constructor and related functions
Update existing MarkdownFileInfo tests

Enhance back_populate Processing
Add logic to use invalid wikilink spans as exclusion zones
Don't attempt to replace text within invalid wikilink spans
Create function to format invalid wikilinks table
Update existing back_populate tests
Add tests for exclusion zone functionality
